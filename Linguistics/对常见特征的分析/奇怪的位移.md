“**gap**”指的是句子中一些成分被移动之后留下的空缺，比如

He told me _ with loud voice that ...

这里发生了heavy NP shift，下划线的位置就有一个gap。

**promotion**指的是将一个句法成分移动到句子中更为显著的地方（通常就是比较前面的地方），比如说被动句的形成就涉及promotion。

# Shifting

举例：heavy NP shifting

此外还有verb-particle结构：

He picked it up. (compare: *He picked up it.)

He picked up the flashlight.

# Extraposition

维基百科：
> Extraposition is a mechanism of syntax that alters word order in such a manner that a relatively "heavy" constituent appears to the right of its canonical position. Extraposing a constituent results in a discontinuity and in this regard, it is unlike shifting, which does not generate a discontinuity. The extraposed constituent is separated from its governor by one or more words that dominate its governor. Two types of extraposition are acknowledged in theoretical syntax: standard cases where extraposition is optional and it-extraposition where extraposition is obligatory. Extraposition is motivated in part by a desire to reduce center embedding by increasing right-branching and thus easing processing, center-embedded structures being more difficult to process. Extraposition occurs frequently in English and related languages.

举例：

a. Someone who we don't know left a message. (正常语序)

b. Someone left a message who we don't know. (Extraposition of relative clause out of subject )

这对adjunct完全消除掉的理论看起来是一个很大的麻烦，因为这种理论通常会这么分析：

[<sub>DP</sub> D [<sub>CP</sub> someone [ [<sub>C</sub> that] ... ]  ] ]

不过我注意到一个细节，就是以the开头的DP似乎不参与extraposition？下面的句子似乎读不通：

? The man is killed who just won a big prize.

extraposition和通常的wh-前置等并不相同。例如下面的extraposition是不对的：

That we think that the idea is good is no secret.

-> *That we think is no secret that the idea is good.

但是下面的wh-前置是对的：

They mentioned that they like the coffee. 

-> What did they mention that they like.

有些extraposition是必须要有的，比如说it开头的句子：

It is claimed that ...

*It that ... is claimed

That ... is claimed.
